# Social_Network_Graph_Representation
This was the final project for a Data Structures and Algoritms class. 
Given a text file in which each line represented a connection between two users on a social network, 
the goal was to turn this txt file into a graph data structure and complete the following tasks: 
1)Find which users are close friends.
2)Recommend new friends given any random user.
